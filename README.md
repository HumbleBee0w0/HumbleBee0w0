- 🐝 Hi, I’m @HumbleBee0w0 , But You can call me Bee!
- 
- 🐝 My pronouns are They/Them and I am 31 yrs old
- 
- 🐝 Some things to know about me are:
- 
- 🐝I am a genshin multishipper, but please don't assume that because you like a ship, I will.
- 
- 🐝Some ships I like are as follows:  JeanXLisa, ChongyunXXingqiu(They're soft and cute), AyatoXThoma,BeiGuang KazuWanderer/KazuScara,LumineXXiao or Lyney,Kaeya with Albedo or Childe, I don't mind ArleFurl.
- 
- 🐝In that same sense, PLEASE respect that I don't like: ZhongChi, Wriollette(They make me uncomfortable. If you don't respect this, I will block you.), JiaoqiuMoze,  KaeLuc(its on sight I'll block you immediately bro), IttoGorou, 

- 🐝I don't mind cuddles or hugs but if you start shoving yourself in between me in my friends, I will hide you or block you
  
  
- 🐝The only Exceptions to the ship rule is certain friends who I feel comfortable with. You may see me with them: Asuraid, CharmedVirus,Tomo, or Lily. 
  
- 🐝I am a CanonXOC shipper, if that bothers you, the block button exists for a reason : )

- 🐝I have a beautiful OC named Quifrey that I ship with Neuvillette. They can be found here: https://toyhou.se/29124347.quifrey

- 🐝I am non-sharing. If you ship an oc with Neuvillette too, I don't mind but please refrain from blowing them up around me.Failure to respect this gets you a hide permanently<3

- 🐝This also means I love Yumeships OR CanonXOC ships.  I will participate in sitting with your oc as a canon character- It brings me absolute delight : D
